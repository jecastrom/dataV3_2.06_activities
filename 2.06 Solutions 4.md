# 2.06 Activity 4

## 1. Check if referential integrity is followed in the following tables?

![Referential Integrity Constraint Check](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/2.5-referential_integrity_constraint.png)



*Referential integrity is a set of rules that ensures that table relationships are consistent. Because each database table must have a primary key, it may appear in other tables as a result of its connection to data within those tables. A foreign key is one type of relationship between tables. In this case the rule is being followed as the CompanyID is being refered on the InsuranceCompany table as a foreign key.*



## 2. Now use the `bank` database to make the following changes:

      a. Use the insert command to create a new entry in the `loan` 
      table with the following values (8000,8000000,930705,96396,12,8033.0,'C'). 
      Here each element corresponds to the values in columns in the table (in the 
      order the columns appear in the table). This might raise an error. Why is that?


```sql
INSERT INTO
    loan
VALUES
    (8000, 8000000, 930705, 96396, 12, 8033.0, 'C');
```
*I was able to insert the values succesfully.*


      b. Use the delete command to delete an entry from the 
      table account where the `account_id` is `11382`. Does 
      this result in an error? If it does, then why?

```sql
DELETE FROM
    account
WHERE
    account_id = 11382;
```
 
      
 
## 3. Create the rest of the tables in the `bank` database (at least the `client` and the `card` tables)
<br></br>
### Answer:
<br></br>

## 4. Design and create a new database structure. Justify your changes.
  Some ideas include renaming columns to ones that make more sense 
  and, for eg., in the table `district`, adding foreign keys 
  wherever necessary.
<br></br>
### Answer:
<br></br>

This is the original database bank schema:
<br></br>

<br></br>


The following are the improvements I made to the schema and I will focus on 3 tables examples:

### Table *'district'*

- I split the table into three different entities: *district, region and demographics*. This helps to reference the same information in various places in the database, such as addresses, loans etc. This complies with the 2dn Normal Form (2NF).
- Each table has a Primary key that uniquely identifies the rows to achieve Referential Integrity.

<br></br>

### Table *"client, disp"*:   

- In the original table, there was a "virtual" relationship between the tables "client", "district", and "disp", but not reenforced in the database design. There was no primary keys or foreign key references. The "disp" table describes the types of customers that the bank holds, Owner or Disponent. I have changed the name of this table to "client_status" for better understanding. 
- The table "address" was non-existent in the previous design. There was a column called "district_id" in the "client" table but again, no foreign key. This table holds the addresses of the customers and any other addresses such as Branch addresses, other banks addresses, among others.
- This led me to also create "phone" and "postcode" as separate entities that have a close relationship with "address". These new primary keys can be referenced in many other systems such as insurance or other activities to avoid data redundancy.

<br></br>


<br></br>
This is the re-designed database schema:

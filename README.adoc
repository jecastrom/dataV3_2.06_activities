= Activity 1
== Get different card types.

`*_Answer:_*`
   
```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT TYPE
FROM
    card;
```

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146673958-3cf79587-6160-458f-bcdb-8c1fb0bfec04.png[width=100]


== Get transactions in the first 15 days of 1993.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    trans
WHERE
    date BETWEEN 930101
    AND 930115;
```

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146674008-ea99725a-ce60-4ee1-8c49-4751ea79e2df.png[width=600]

== Get all running loans.

`*_Answer:_*`


_In the database doc running loans are described as: Status 'C': stands for running contract, OK so far._

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    loan
WHERE
    STATUS = 'C';
```

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146674040-85bb136d-347f-4b76-aa47-f07bc7931814.png[width=450]
   

== Find the different values from the field `A2` that start with the letter 'K'.

`*_Answer:_*`

_Here we can use the REGEXP (regular expressions) to help with the search of data matching complex criteria_

```sql
SELECT
    A2
FROM
    district
WHERE
    A2 REGEXP '^K';
```

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146674051-f96cd607-6015-460b-a46b-f8653b62a8e2.png[width=300]
   

== Find the different values from the field `A2` that end with the letter 'K'.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    A2
FROM
    district
WHERE
    A2 REGEXP 'K$';
```

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146674071-f0a07646-39f2-4089-8cca-dc46892edaa1.png[width=300]


== Discuss the possible use cases of using regular expressions in your query.

`*_Answer:_*`

_MySQL Regular expressions allow us to search data matching even more complex criterion._

= Activity 2


== Can you use the following query:

```sql
select * from bank.district
where a3 like 'north%M%';
```

instead of:

```sql
select * from bank.district
where a3 like 'north_M%';
```

Try both the queries and check the results.


```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    bank.district
WHERE
    a3 LIKE 'north%M%';
```
image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146674746-15bb46e0-82a9-4616-a774-27361d4c9eda.png[width=600]


_This query can be used if you are looking for a value which starts with north and has a capital M anywhere after north. This is the reason why the query brings back Noth Bohamia and North Moravia. The % allows you to match any string of any length including cero length_


```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    bank.district
WHERE
    a3 LIKE 'north_M%';
```
image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146674772-4a3ca43e-ce0c-4223-8e7b-2c853b8b307a.png[width=600]



_This query is more granular asking for a value that matches north and only one character or anything of the sort but only one then a value that starts with capital M and any character after._



 We looked at the following query in class:

```sql
select * from bank.district
where a2 regexp 'ch[e-r]';
```


== Can you modify the query to print the rows only for those values in the **A2** column that starts with **'CH'**?

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    bank.district
WHERE
    a2 REGEXP '^ch';
```
image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146674925-65d786dc-7d85-4ce5-b5b6-1e3267f91c4b.png[width=600]

Use the table `trans` for this query. Use the column `type` to test: "By default, in an ascending sort, special characters appear first, followed by numbers, and then letters."

Again use the table `trans` for this query. Use the column `k_symbol` to test: "Null values appear first if the order is ascending."

Pick any table and any column to test: "You can use any column from the table to sort the values even if that column is not used in the select statement." Check the difference by writing the query with and without that column (column used to sort the results) in the select statement.

= Activity 3

== Which other problems you may think non-normalized structure may have?

During the lesson, we mentioned that one of the primary reasons for normalizing tables is to eliminate data redundancy. Otherwise, data redundancy can result in highly inefficient data storages. Which other problems you may think non-normalized structure may have?

The students can refer to the following link to read more about normalization, its advantages and disadvantages. (https://whatisdbms.com/normalization-in-dbms-anomalies-advantages-disadvantages/)


`*_Answer:_*`


_When several instances of the same data are scattered across different tables without proper relationship/link, it can cause strange conditions where some will get updated with new values whereas others won't. This leaves our database in an inconsistent state!_


Later in the labs we will use another database that models a DVD rental store. ERD (entity relationship diagram) for the database is shown below. You can refer the file `sakila-schema.pdf` in the files_for_activities folder as well.

[./files_for_activities/sakila-schema.pdf]



== Identify the primary keys and foreign keys from the ER diagram.

`*_Answer:_*`

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/146691318-d9e34136-e026-4e08-9fa3-c15fa66f866d.png[width=200]

https://github.com/jecastrom/dataV3_2.06_activities/files/7741627/Sakila.Foreign.Keys.pdf[Sakila Foreign Keys.pdf]


= Activity 4

== Check if referential integrity is followed in the following tables



image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/147394013-71387c27-a53e-44c3-b61c-3f72c177dd82.png[width=540]

`*_Answer:_*`

_Referential integrity is a set of rules that ensures that table relationships are consistent. Because each database table must have a primary key, it may appear in other tables as a result of its connection to data within those tables. A foreign key is one type of relationship between tables. In this case the rule is being followed as the CompanyID is being refereed on the InsuranceCompany table as a foreign key._



== Now use the `bank` database to make the following changes:

* Use the insert command to create a new entry in the `loan` table with the following values (8000,8000000,930705,96396,12,8033.0,'C'). Here each element corresponds to the values in columns in the table (in the 
order the columns appear in the table). This might raise an error. Why is that?

`Answer:`

```sql
INSERT INTO
    loan
VALUES
    (8000, 8000000, 930705, 96396, 12, 8033.0, 'C');
```
_I was able to insert the values successfully._


* Use the delete command to delete an entry from the table account where the `account_id` is `11382`. Does 
this result in an error? If it does, then why?

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
DELETE FROM
    account
WHERE
    account_id = 11382;
```
 
      
 
== Create the rest of the tables in the `bank` database (at least the `client` and the `card` tables)

`*_Answer:_*`


== Design and create a new database structure. Justify your changes.

  Some ideas include renaming columns to ones that make more sense 
  and, for eg., in the table `district`, adding foreign keys 
  wherever necessary.

`*_Answer:_*`


This is the original database bank schema:



image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/147342440-cbd7ff8c-3426-4150-b8ef-5539cd6f63ae.png[width=800]




_The following are the improvements I made to the schema and I will focus on 3 tables examples:_

* Table *'district'*

_I split the table into three different entities: *district, region and demographics*. This helps to reference the same information in various places in the database, such as addresses, loans etc. This complies with the 2dn Normal Form (2NF). Each table has a Primary key that uniquely identifies the rows to achieve Referential Integrity._


image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/147267804-aa3e62fe-b440-4cd6-9ee6-e59e2f8e711e.png[width=800]

* Tables `client` and `disp`:   

_As you can see, the structure in this part of the database is a little bit messy. Let's look at what happened to the "client" and "district" tables when we removed them from the prior schema: -The original table has a virtual connection between it, the tables "client," "district," and the table "disp," but not reinforced in the database design. There were no primary keys or foreign key references. The name of this table was changed to "client_status" for clarity._

_The table "address" in the previous design did not exist. There was a column called "district_id" in the "client" table, but there was no foreign key. This table holds customer addresses as well as any other addresses, such as Branch addresses or other banks' addresses._

_This is how I came up with "phone" and "postcode," which are two distinct things that have a close link to "address." These new fundamental keys can be used in other systems, such as insurance or other services, to minimize data redundancy._

_This is the re-designed database schema:_

_After creating the demobank database, this is the ERD from MySQL Workbench:_

* To sum it up:


.From an inicial 8 tables and 54 columns database with only 1 primary key, the new database has:
[horizontal]
Total Tables:: 22
Total Columns:: 103
Total Primary keys:: 22            
Total Foreign Keys:: 30                 
Added extra columns:: 49


There were tables and columns with reserved MySQL keywords: _order, transaction, account, client, date, type_ which were changed for alternatives. The 1NF is being violated at the "frequency" table. I established a new table called "frequency." Their records in this table are not unique because there are two values: the frequency or how often consumers receive statements of account and the account fee charge.  

By creating different tables to distinguish values not related to the primary key, you can enforce the 2NF (second normal form). Also, by establishing connections between tables and maintaining foreign keys, you can ensure data integrity and compliance with the 3NF (third normal form).    

To store dates, I used the DATE AND DATETIME data types rather than the integer data type. For greater precision when dealing with amounts of money, use a decimal (15,2). To ensure that non-positive integers are used, set the attribute "unsigned" to each primary key.    

Finally, I have enabled the "on delete cascade" constraint while adding foreign keys. This will allow us to completely remove a record, and all of the dependent foreign keys will be removed as well. For the purpose of data migration to this database, it is advised that you first create a database with no constraints, migrate the data, then set up primary and foreign keys to reduce concerns when bringing the data for tables.
